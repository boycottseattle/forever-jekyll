Seattle isn’t safe. It’s impossible to partake in a family outing, going out to eat, shopping, visiting a museum, heading to Pike Place Market, taking a walk, going to the gym, visiting with friends, or playing in a park without getting harassed, followed, disturbed, or intimidated by the homeless population.

The solution? More police, enforcement of the laws, private security officers, incarceration and institutionalization of criminals and substance abusers, and clearing out of homeless tents and encampments.

Until it’s safe to enjoy a normal outing in Seattle with your family, we all need to do our part. We need to put pressure on the city by withholding any and all sales tax revenue, by getting business owners to rise up against the council and demand adequate police protection of their businesses.

What could we do to instigate such a change?

Very simply, buy and do everything in nearby cities – not Seattle.

1. Don’t go to Seattle as a tourist.
2. Stop frequenting sporting events – the areas around the stadiums are trash anyways.
3. Stop supporting local businesses. If you pressure the local retailers which pay taxes to the city, they’ll in turn put pressure on the local politicians.
4. Insist and require businesses to hire private security officers for your safety.

To sum it up, in two words, we could enact change:

Boycott Seattle.
