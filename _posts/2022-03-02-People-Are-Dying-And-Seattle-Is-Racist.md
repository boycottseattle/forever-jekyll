There's a new mayor in town. Is he cracking down on crime? Jailing the criminals? Cleaning up the streets? No! He's passing  discriminatory lending practices!

In the latest Small Business Capital Access Program released today, there's a rather important clause about the "[selection process.](https://www.seattle.gov/office-of-economic-development/commercial-affordability/capital-access-program#selectionprocess)" Wherein, it specifically specifies preference will be given to:
- "Small businesses owned by Black, Indigenous and people of color (BIPOC).
- Woman-owned small business."

Businesses are closing down in the downtown area within the last week due to shootings and stabbings. Specifically a [McDonald's](https://www.king5.com/article/news/local/seattle/seattle-mayor-businesses-address-third-avenue-safety/281-e5108d08-df29-4ae4-8936-f151da779739) location is shutting down - at least temporarily, and a [Piroshky Piroshky restaurant](https://www.king5.com/article/news/crime/seattles-piroshky-piroshky-closing-3rd-avenue/281-c855cbd2-b6a0-49fe-a675-6aa768447f41). 

Now, in all fairness, there has been some news about a couple of homeless camps being cleared, but unless this continues on a regular basis and these vagrant bums are kicked the heck out of the city, new encampments will just pop up.

So, what's the business community doing in response to this crime wave? How are they going to stand up against racist lending practices? They won't, they aren't, and here's proof!

On the [Seattle Chamber of Commerce's website](https://www.seattlechamber.com/pages/advocacy/), they are concerned with the following, "inclusion of BIPOC, LGBTQ+, gender-diverse, and veteran-owned businesses." None of this has to do with the safety of customers, employees, or the businesses themselves. It's political nonsense.

Seattle doesn't deserve your money - taxes or patronage. The businesses, politicians, and residents don't care about protecting your safety. They don't care about the workers safety. All they do care about, is that they sound inclusive and equitable. Buzzwords that create racist and divisive policies, do nothing for the general prosperity or betterment of the city, and give politicians a reason to discriminate. 

At least, we've got something new to complain about. Seattle, the joke of a city that keeps on giving.
